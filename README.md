# Implementaion-of-AND-gate-using-NOR-gate
## AIM:
To design a AND gate using NOR gate and verify its truth table in Quartus using Verilog programming.

## Equipments Required:
Hardware – PCs, Cyclone II , USB flasher Software – Quartus prime Theory Adders are digital circuits that carry out addition of numbers.
## Theory
### AND GATE: 
AND gate The AND gate is an electronic circuit that gives a high output (1) only if all its inputs are high. A dot (.) is used to show the AND operation i.e. A.B or can be written as AB

Boolean Expression Y = A.B

### NOR GATE:
This is a NOT-OR gate which is equal to an OR gate followed by a NOT gate. The outputs of all NOR gates are low if any of the inputs are high. The symbol is an OR gate with a small circle on the output. The small circle represents inversion.

Boolean Expression Y = (A+B)'

## Procedure:
Connect the supply (+5V) to the circuit Switch ON the main switch Press the switches for inputs “A” and “B”. 

The switch is ON state when 1 is pressed. 

The switch is OFF state when 0 is pressed. 

If the output is 1, then the bulb glows. 

Check all the gates following the same procedure.

## Program:
Program to verify the truth table in quartus for the basic logic gates using Verilog programming.
